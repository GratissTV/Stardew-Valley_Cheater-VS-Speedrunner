## Preface

Before going with the route, let's first go over some stuff.

### Goal

The general goal of this route is to maximize the total amount of money gained by the end of the first summer. 

The long therm goal of the run however is reaching perfection.

### Rules

You can however use scripts for the animation cancel.

### Other-notes

In spring, if it's raining alwaysFish in the forest river; If sunny, fish in mountain lake.
In Summer, always go fish in the ocean.
