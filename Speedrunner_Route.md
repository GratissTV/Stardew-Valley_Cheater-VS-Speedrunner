# Min-Max route plan
- This is the completa route manual for the vanilla player. It cointains the most important and crucial steps in order to reach around 5 mln gold before autumn.

- This route has been planned specifically for this duo gamemode, in wich the other player can cheat with item codes but cant trade/pay anything to the vanilla player. More info in the RULES file.

- This route has been planned specifically for a Joja run, using the new farm type from 1.6 (just bcs it's new and we liked it).

## Preface

Before going with the route, let's first go over some stuff.

### Goal

The general goal of this route is to maximize the total amount of money gained by the end of the first summer. 

The long therm goal of the run however is reaching perfection.

### Rules

Since this is the vanilla route, you cannot use cheats or exploits in any way. You cannot use external tools such as the weather predictor. You cannot use mods.
You can however use scripts for the animation cancel.

### Other-notes

In spring, if it's raining always fish in the forest river; If sunny, fish in mountain lake.
In Summer, always go fish in the ocean.

Start with Female character (you get 500g instead of a cookie)

Generally Mushrooms >>> bats

- If you reach the bottom of the mines, revert to farming more ore. 
- At 12 AM, go home and craft + place as many sprinklers as possible. (If you do not have enough sprinklers to cover all of the crops, that is okay.)
- It should be 2 AM after this. If not, cut down grass and pass out.

### Spring 17

### Spring 20

- At 9 AM, go to Clint and upgrade to the [Copper Axe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axes) (2,000g).

### Spring 22

- Ship enough items to get 2,000g for the [Copper Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoes) upgrade.

### Spring 23

- At 9 AM, go to Clint, retrieve the [Steel Axe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axes), and upgrade to the [Copper Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoes) (2,000g).
- Now that you have the [Steel Axe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axes), if you get a bad luck day, use it to clear space on your farm and prepare for your sprinklers. This will need to be done on the 27th at the latest, even if it is not a bad luck day.
  - However, you **must** get level 10 mining first before taking any days off because you need the Blacksmith profession before Spring 25.
  - Remember, you also need to set up Scarecrows and Parsnip Seeds (as a linger crop).

### Spring 24

- Ship as many items as possible. (We want as much gold for tomorrow as possible.)

### Spring 25

- Plan out how many [Starfruit Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Starfruit_Seeds) (400g each) that you will be planting on Summer 2. This will depend on how well your run is going. Make sure to account for the future revenue from Skull Cavern runs between now and Summer 2. Note that you will need around two full days to clear and prepare the farm. (You may have already spent one day clearing if you got an unlucky day between Spring 23 and now.) You should aim for around 400-500 Starfruit Seeds.
- At 9 AM, go to Clint, retrieve the [Copper Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoes), and upgrade to the [Steel Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoes) (5,000g).
- Go to the [Oasis](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oasis) and buy 1 [Deluxe Speed-Gro](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Deluxe_Speed-Gro) for every Starfruit Seed that you plan to purchase.
  - The Oasis only sells Deluxe Speed-Gro on Thursdays and we need it by Summer 2.
  - Note that you must use a [Warp Totem: Desert](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Warp_Totem:_Desert) to access the desert today, since [Pam](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pam) will go to the clinic for an appointment (instead of driving the bus). On most runs, this is never an issue, since you are generally using Warp Totems on every single day to prevent wasting time & gold.
- Spend the rest of your money on Starfruit Seeds so that you can pass out without penalty. (You will buy the rest of the Starfruit Seeds on Summer 2.)

### Spring 26

- Nothing notable on this day.

### Spring 27

- Harvest the second batch of Kale. (This should get you to farming level 6.)
- At 9 AM, go to Clint and retrieve the [Steel Hoe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hoes).

### Spring 28

- Check the Queen of Sauce for the [Omelet](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Omelet) recipe.
- Ship as many items as possible. (We want as much gold for tomorrow as possible.)
- Craft + place Quality Sprinklers.
- Plant Parsnip Seeds (as a "linger" crop) if you haven't already done so earlier on in the season.
  - Do not use Deluxe Speed-Gro on the Parsnip Seeds, as it will not carry over to Summer 1.
- If you finish before around noon, then you can spend the rest of the day in the Skull Cavern.

### Summer 1

- Nothing notable on this day. Can do a Skull Cavern run, etc. Don't scythe any of the Parsnips since we do not need to plant any Starfruit Seeds until tomorrow. (This is because the Agriculturist profession will affect the third batch of Starfruit.)

### Summer 2

- Scythe + plant all of the Deluxe Speed-Gro + the first batch of Starfruit Seeds that was purchased on Spring 25.
- At 9 AM, go to the [Oasis](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oasis) and purchase the rest of the Starfruit Seeds, then return home and plant them.
- This will take the majority of the day. If you have any time left:
  - Craft + place around 10-20 [Lightning Rods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Lightning_Rod).
  - Craft + place [Tappers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper) on the Oak trees scattered around your farm that you did not cut down.
  - Continue to plant acorns in a corner of the farm to build up an Oak tree forest.

### Summer 3

- Do a Skull Cavern run. (We need enough money to buy 25,000g to upgrade to the [Iridium Pickaxe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axes).)

### Summer 4

- Smelt Iridium Bars. Later on in the day when they are finished (around 2:30 PM), go to Clint and upgrade to the [Iridium Pickaxe](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Axes). (If you need more money beyond just what the Iridium Bars provide, you can sell some gems directly to Clint.)
- Craft + place around 10-20 [Lightning Rods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Lightning_Rod).
- Craft + place [Tappers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper) on the [Oak Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree) scattered around your farm that you did not cut down.
- Continue to plant [Acorns](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Acorn) in a corner of the farm to build up an [Oak Tree](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree) forest.
- We are going to need as much [Oak Resin](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Resin) as possible for [Kegs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg). [Tree Fertilizer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tree_Fertilizer) is extremely handy for growing our Oak tree forest very quickly, but we need level 7 foraging to craft it. The best way to level up foraging skill without actually wasting much in-game time is to craft and harvest [Summer Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer_Seeds) (as opposed to chopping down trees or walking the relatively long distance to the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods) to chop down stumps).
- Thus, on days when you are not in the Skull Cavern (like today), you should:
  - Look around the map for summer foragable items so that you can craft at least 10-20 [Summer Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer_Seeds). When the Summer Seeds are harvested, re-craft and re-plant as many Summer Seeds as possible (until you get to level 7 foraging).
  - Chop down the 5 stumps in the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods) to get both foraging XP and [Hardwood](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hardwood). (You will need 100 Hardwood for the [Stable](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stable).)
  - As soon as you have 100 hardwood, you should purchase the Stable from Robin, which will make you waste less time on subsequent Secret Woods runs. (You need will need 150 hardwood for the second farmhouse upgrade.)

### Summer 5 & Beyond

- Do more Skull Cavern runs. We need to build up as much money as possible for the second batch of Starfruit Seeds.

### Summer 9

- Ship enough items to buy the second batch of Starfruit Seeds.

### Summer 10

- Buy the second batch of Starfruit Seeds. (We have to buy them today because the Oasis is closed tomorrow for the Luau.)

### Summer 11

- Harvest + replant. (The Deluxe Speed-Gro will stay on the tiles, so you should not have to re-apply any.)
- Do not sell any Starfruit - it should be going into kegs, even the gold-quality ones. At this point you should be tapping as many [Oak Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree) as possible and building as many [Kegs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg) as possible. (Buy the necessary wood from Robin when you run out.)
  - Don't sell any wine until you have re-specialized from Agriculturist to Artisan using the [Statue of Uncertainty](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Statue_of_Uncertainty).
- To start with, you can fill your house with kegs. Later on, it is convenient to buy several [Big Sheds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shed) and place them near the house. Alternatively, once you unlock the [Quarry](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quarry), you can cover it with flooring and use it to stockpile kegs.
- At the end of the day, you should get farming level 10. Choose the Agriculturist profession.
  - Unfortunately, the benefit from Agriculturist will not affect the crops that were planted today.
  - We will re-spec to Artisan later on before selling any of the Starfruit Wine.

### Summer 13 & Beyond

- Summer 13 is guaranteed to be a stormy day.
- At some point on or after Summer 13, buy and plant any other summer crops that you need for bundles/quests/presents/whatever.
- The longest crops to grow are [Melons](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Melon) and [Blueberries](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Blueberry), which will take 10 days with the Agriculturist profession. With Deluxe Speed-Gro, you can speed this up to 7 days. So you can defer planting extra summer crops to Summer 21 at the latest.

### Summer 19

- Ship enough items for the third batch of Starfruit.

### Summer 20

- Harvest the [Starfruit](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Starfruit).
- At 9 AM, go to the [Oasis](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oasis) and buy the second batch of [Starfruit Seeds](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Starfruit_Seeds).
- Plant the Starfruit Seeds. (The [Deluxe Speed-Gro](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Deluxe_Speed-Gro) will stay on the tiles, so you should not have to re-apply any.)

### Summer 24

- Ship enough items to buy more [Deluxe Speed-Gro](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Deluxe_Speed-Gro). (You will be covering your whole farm with [Pumpkins](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pumpkin), so you will need additional Speed-Gro beyond what will carry-over from the Starfruit squares.)

### Summer 25

- Buy additional [Deluxe Speed-Gro](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Deluxe_Speed-Gro) from the [Oasis](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oasis).
- Sometime between now and Summer 28, hoe and place all the quality sprinklers and additional Deluxe Speed-Gro. The wheat will not be ready on Fall 2 if the soil is not watered on the Summer 28.

### Summer 26

- Summer 26 is guaranteed to be a stormy day.
